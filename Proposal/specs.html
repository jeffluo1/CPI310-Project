    <h2>Project Specifications</h2><br>   
    <h3>Purpose</h3> 
    <p>to give individuals a place to vent about different games, creating and finding threads.</p>
    <h3>List of Deliverables</h3>
    <p>in essence, a website. Homepage will only show 20 thumbnails based of titles of the diff threads, once clicked on, go to new page with the full thread. Back page needed. Main page has sort by new and most viewed. Click on arrows to get to different pages. Adding a thread, submit button creates a new page, adds it to the thread database, which then updates the main page, and puts it at the top (if sorted by new)</p>
    <h3>Use Case</h3>
    <p> developer (change code and everything), guest (only view), admin (they can control which threads to delete, for now the developers), user (post, read, comment but can’t delete other thread, only their post). Users can login, post (images, text, and maybe gifs).</p>
    <h3>Database Design</h3>
    <p>username, password, email, account type (only user account is available at first) —— continue as guest button (guest account is on the website by default, this is the one we use)</p>
