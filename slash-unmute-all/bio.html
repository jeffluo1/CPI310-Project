   <p> ANTHONY NGO: My Whole Life, I have resided in Arizona. Often, I seeo myself as an individual who came from very humble beginning. My parents imiigrated to America with a very common "Just the shirts on their backs" story from Saigon, Vietnam. Growing up, it seemed almost natural that hardwork and respect leads to good rewards and outcomes. A year after highschool, I found myself spending ten months going through training with the army to join the national guard. This would be my route to pay for college. Eventually I made it to ASU, where I found my curiousity for technology led to a passion in computer sciences. 
    <p>Aside from programming, I find a large amount of my time dedicated to the campus cultural club, The Vietnamese Student Association. As the current president, past vice president, and chair member of multiple positions on the regional level, I have almost madeit to be a duty to serve the community that I love the most. In time I hope to utilize my various skills to somehow improve the world while making a substainable income. To learn more specifics about me,

   <p>DHANTIN KUMAR: I am currently studying at Arizona State University, seeking to complete my B.S. in Computer Science at the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering. I am also part of Barrett, The Honors College, and will be pursuing my honors thesis, which will focus on music integration with Computer Science.

   <p>EDWARD KIM: I am from the island of Oahu and came to Arizona for university. I am an Informatics Major in the focus area of Digital culture. Since I am from Oahu, Hawaii experiencing mainland was quite new for me. It was pretty overwhelming but now I think I got the hand of it. During my High school I focused a lot on my studies and also was where I noticed I wanted to partake in the major I chose for University.
    </p>
    <p>
    In University I first started as a Computer Engineer major but then instantly noticed this was not what my passion was telling me to go with. This then lead to me changing my major to Computer Science. Since it tackled programming and I was very interested in that. However as my first semester was coming to a close in my sophmore year. I then noticed that this was not what I wanted to do. I wanted to be more creative and also still would like to be coding. This was when I looked heavily in the Majors given by Arizona State University and found the Informatics major. This was definetley what I wanted to do due to how flexible and somewhat free my flow chart was, but what really caught my eye was the amount of Web Development coding I am able to take, while focusing on the digital culture area that allows me to be expressive and creative in what I do.
